# Free-USA-Dropdown-Enter-City-or-ZIP-2024
I express my gratitude to this [individual](https://github.com/niiknow) who was able to find/create the most complete [database](https://github.com/niiknow/zipcode-us) of cities, zip-codes, counties, coordinates etc. of the United States of America.

I in turn provided you with the best, in my opinion, strategy how to implement it in the web as optimized as it can be possibly made. I created python script that would sort database provided by [niiknow](https://github.com/niiknow) into 2 folders. The first folder, `cities-in-alphabetical-order`, contains ZIP code information sorted alphabetically, organizing every city/locality in the U.S. by its initial letter. The second folder is organized with 10,000 zip codes in each .js file, covering zip codes in the range from 0 to 99,999 (00000 - 99999). This database includes zip codes that may not exist, providing flexibility for users. If you can't find your zip code in this database, please feel free to start a discussion, and we will add it in. Let's work together as a community to maintain the most up-to-date zip code database for the U.S.
